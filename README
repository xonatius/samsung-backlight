## Installation

git clone git://github.com/xonatius/samsung-backlight.git
cd samsung-backlight
make
sudo make install

On some os you need to add samsung_backlight module to modules list. (f.e /etc/modules) After reboot it should work.
Often you need to add acpi_backlight=vendor to the kernel boot options, to makes your system work with backlight. (F.E. In ubuntu you had to edit /etc/default/grub and add the acpi_backlight=vendor to the end of GRUB_CMD_LINUX_DEFAULT line and then run update-grub)

## Other samsung laptop models

If you've got samsung laptop with intel graphics card and it hasn't supported backlight control, you could create an issue with "lspci -nn" and "dmidecode -s system-product-name
" information.
